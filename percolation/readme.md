# Percolation

For this assignment, only the Percolation.java and PercolationStats.java files were required. However, the PercolationVisualizer proved to be a useful tool for visualizing and debugging the issues in my percolation implementation.

The PercolationVisualizer is a tool provided by Princeton University that graphically represents the percolation process. While using this tool, I had to make several modifications to ensure it functioned correctly with my implementation. Specifically, I adjusted it so it wouldn't use the (0,0) coordinates and properly visualized the grid size I was working with.
